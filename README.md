# RN-Walk-Route-Tracking-App

Working on React Native app for tracking walking/driving routes.

TODO: Fix Tab Navigation state on signout. Tab Navigator retains state on log out, when you log out & in again you return to account screen. Should return to initial route.

Known Issues: Bug in current Expo SDK, keyboard moves views even when wrapped in KeyboardAvoidingView https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/7589. Will monitor for updates
